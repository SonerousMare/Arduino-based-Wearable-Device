# Arduino-based-Wearable-Device
The aim of this project was to develop a **magnetic field sensor to alert patients with implanted devices** of any danger near them. Strong magnetic fields can affect the functioning of very important implanted devices such as cochlear implants or pacemakers!


_Will add to this later...Stay tuned_
